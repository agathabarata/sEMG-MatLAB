# sEMG-MatLAB
 In this work we propose to create a basic interface to process myoelectric signals capable of triggering mechanisms, such as servos, motors with proportional dynamic muscle activity.
 The signals were recorded using a differential amplifier of high input impedance, which initially conditioned signal in a bandwidth of greater power, established for sEMG. The signal was digitized into a Galileo development platform. The signal was digitized in 16-bits by Grass Instruments Inc and then passed the AD converter of the Galile Gen 1 and processed through its own library to read the file in (abf) in MATLAB environment, which triggered a servo-motor through the collection of the signal in its raw form, rectifying in wave -complete, filtering and extracting the RMS value according to the muscular activity. The signal tested showed good performance in data transmission even with external interferences. For certain areas of health, such as neuroscience, physiotherapy and biomedicine, controlling servo motors through myoelectric signals caters to the need of individuals with special needs. Here, the nature of this research is justified, which aims, in the future, to create prostheses for amputees or patients with poor training.
